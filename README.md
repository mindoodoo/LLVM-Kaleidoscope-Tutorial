# LLVM-Kaleidoscope-Tutorial

After a frustrating attempt to generate [LLVM IR code](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) for my [brainfuck compiler](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Brainfuck-Compiler), I reluctantly decided to completely implement the [tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/) as an attempt to better understand LLVM and it's api.
